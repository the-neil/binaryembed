binaryembed
===========

A long, long time ago I once needed (well, wanted) to embed multiple binary files inside of a single executable so that I could later, at run-time, write them out to disk and use them. This is just a tiny tool that converts whatever file you point it at into C code and pushes it to stdout, which you can then copy-paste it into your source.
